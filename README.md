# LoanPredictionCodeAndTool
This repository contains the code for a loan prediction machine learning model and an interactive prediction tool. The machine learning model, implemented in the notebook "HomeLoanPredictionML_RF.ipynb", is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The project leverages the "Home Loan Predictions" dataset, uploaded by GOVARDHAN C on Kaggle.com, specifically utilizing the loan_sanction_train.csv file for training purposes.

The machine learning model is trained on this dataset and the resulting model is saved as a ".joblib file". This saved model is then imported into the prediction tool, implemented in the notebook HomeLoanPredictorTool_RF.ipynb. This tool provides an interactive application that allows users to predict loan status based on input information.
